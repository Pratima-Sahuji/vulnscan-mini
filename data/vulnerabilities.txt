SQL Injection occurs when user input is concatenated into SQL queries without sanitization.
Attackers can read, modify, or delete database data.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into web pages.

Command Injection happens when user input is passed directly to system commands.

Insecure Dependencies are libraries with known CVEs that expose systems to exploits.

Open Ports and Misconfiguration expose unintended services to attackers.
